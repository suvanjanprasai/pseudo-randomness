# pseudo-randomness
It is a program that generates pseudo-random number when an upper limit is provided as an input by performing random maths.
The program fetches the current microsecond using datetime module and performs some random mathematical operations to achieve randomness.
The program is just an example of how actually random number generators work.
The randomness of the generated number can be increased by simply increasing random mathematical operations.
It is not recommended to use such logic in real-life applications because; if anyhow someone sees the code(maths) behind the program, they can easily guess the random number by doing exact mathematical operations.
